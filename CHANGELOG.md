# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Built-in terminal themes:** 27 ship with the client (17 dark, 10 light) and need no Ghostty install: Rex Linux's own **Merino Dark** and **Merino Light**, Midnight, and Ayu, Catppuccin, Dracula, Everforest, Flexoki, Gruvbox, Kanagawa, Nord, One, Rosé Pine and Solarized with the colours of their Ghostty theme files. `docs/terminal-themes.md` lists each one's project, author and licence, and packages carry it as `licenses/TERMINAL-THEMES.md`. The library on Settings → Themes groups them as Built in dark and Built in light.
- **A light and a dark terminal theme:** Settings → Themes → Light and dark themes (off by default) declares one theme while the appearance is light and another while it is dark, starting with Merino Light and Merino Dark. Appearance is Auto (follow the desktop's light or dark setting), Light or Dark. A change of appearance declares the other theme once; a launch waits for the desktop's setting before it declares either. The window's own colours stay dark. New settings: `terminal_theme: "light_dark"`, `light_theme`, `dark_theme` and `color_scheme`; older files load unchanged and keep their one theme.
- **AT-SPI accessibility tree**, from Rune's new default `accessibility` feature, which stays on. Checked with an AT-SPI client script on a private bus; not tried with Orca or another screen reader. Chrome buttons, tabs, switches, segmented controls, text fields (with caret, selection and edit events), dialogs and notices have roles, names and states, and notices raise announcements. The terminal pane exposes its visible rows as plain labels only: no text interface, caret, selection or focus. See the README's Accessibility section for what was observed and what is missing.
- **Accessibility names and states from that check:** the active toolbar and sidebar tab reports selected; dialogs are named by their title; each terminal pane is named `Terminal <pane name>`; and the switcher and Commands report the highlighted row (as an active descendant), so an AT-SPI client is told which row is highlighted as you arrow through the list.
- **Server version in About:** each host connection now asks its Rex server for its version once with a read-only `server.version` request, and keeps the status the session list already carries (process, sessions, listeners, Tailscale state). Settings → About shows `Rex Server <version>` for the active host with the negotiated API revision and the range the server supports; a server that doesn't answer is shown as not reported and nothing else changes.
- **Copy debug info**, next to **Copy version info** in Settings → About: the version info plus the install channel, display server, desktop, interface theme and zoom, terminal font, and each saved host's kind, connection state, API revision and server version. Neither copy contains a host name, address, session name, client id or credential. Commands gains **About Rex Linux**, **Copy version info** and **Copy debug info**, and About links to the issue tracker.
- **Pane menu verbs:** right-clicking a pane now offers Copy, Paste, Select all, Copy pane ID, Clear terminal and Reset terminal, beside splits on all four sides (right, left, down, up). Every row acts on the pane that was clicked; Copy needs a selection, and Paste, Clear and Reset a live terminal. Clear and Reset send Rex's `terminal.clear` / `terminal.reset` once and are never sent again after a failure; they are covered by tests against a scripted server, not yet tried against a real one.
- **Pane header buttons and a Pane headers setting:** a pane's header ends in Split right, Split down, Zoom (or Restore) and Close, which act on that pane, and shows a `Zoomed` chip. Settings → Interface → Pane headers offers Auto (the default, and what earlier versions did), Always, On hover and Hidden; **Reveal pane headers** in Commands floats them until it is run again.
- **Find bar:** terminal search has a match counter, Find next, Find previous and Close buttons, and moves to another corner rather than cover the selected match. It takes whole rows and columns of the terminal, so no sliver of a row shows beside it. Unselected matches are a light tint with an outline, so dim terminal text stays readable on them. Find next and Find previous are actions too and reopen the last search on a pane whose bar is closed.
- **Tab management:** the tab menu, on toolbar tabs and now on sidebar tab rows, gains Mute tab (no activity word, progress bar or notification from that tab on this client), Move left and right (`Ctrl Shift PageUp` / `PageDown`) and Close other tabs…; the rename dialog offers **Use default title** for a tab you named. Sidebar tab rows take middle-click to close and double-click to rename.
- **Commands lists every command**, under Session, Tab, Pane, Host, View, Appearance and App headings that name what is on screen, about twenty rows at a time, and searches them as one list, best match first. New rows include Next and Previous session, Refresh sessions, Close session…, Focus next and previous pane, Split best fit, Move pane and Resize pane toward each side, Close other panes…, Collapse other hosts, Reveal toolbar, Change theme… and Change window colours…, pane density and tab position, interface zoom, terminal font size, Change shortcuts…, About Rex Linux, Rex help and Report an issue. A search of two or more letters also lists the window colours and terminal themes whose names match, under Appearance; Return applies one. A host's own actions that need no arguments are listed under Server actions.
- **Search Settings:** a field at the top of the Settings sidebar finds a section or a single setting by its name, its description or the heading it is under, and then the actions of the Shortcuts page by name. Enter or a click opens the result and marks the setting's or the action's row for a moment; Escape ends the search. Typing while the section list has the keyboard starts one. The search reads the pages themselves, so every setting is found without a separate list.
- **Back and Forward in Settings:** a pair of buttons before the page title, `Alt Left` and `Alt Right`, and the pointer's Back and Forward buttons step through the pages visited since Settings opened, each where it was left scrolled.
- **Settings pages under a section:** Interface → Customize panes and Customize tabs, Terminal → Advanced font settings, and each program state on Notifications (Needs you, Fails, Finishes, Starts working) open a page of their own. The title shows the section first, and the sidebar keeps it selected. The keyboard goes to Back when a page opens; Back, the section's name in the title or Escape returns to the section where it was scrolled, with the keyboard on the row that opened the page. Escape closes Settings from a section's own page.
- **Terminal font size actions:** Increase, Decrease and Reset terminal font size, in Commands and bindable in `shortcuts.json` (`client.font.increase` / `decrease` / `reset`), change the size by a point or reset it. They have no default keys, so `Ctrl Alt +` / `−` / `0` still reach terminal programs; `Ctrl +` / `−` / `0` stay interface zoom.
- **Keycap hints everywhere from the keymap:** menu rows, Commands, the switcher, the sidebar's search chip and toolbar tooltips show each action's current binding, so a rebind in `shortcuts.json` shows everywhere at once. The actions added this cycle are all bindable, listed on Settings → Shortcuts, and refused to remote callers.
- **Settings → Shortcuts lists every action**, bound or not, with **Not set** on the ones without a key; an action with a direction has a row a direction. All of an action's bindings share its row, in the order keys are tried, and a row says where a key is from, which other action shares or took it, and which default `shortcuts.json` removed. A **Filter shortcuts…** field above the list takes a name or a key: `ctrl+k` lists everything bound to that key, the action it performs first. With a host connected, the titled server actions Commands lists are rows too; that part is covered by headless tests against a recorded-shape reply, not a live server.
- **Recording shortcuts:** every binding on Settings → Shortcuts is a button, and an action without one has **Record shortcut**. The recorder shows the keys as typed (a sequence of up to four), saves on Enter or Save, cancels on Escape, and removes a binding with its bin button or Backspace; it warns when the keys are also bound to another action. Recordings are kept in the app's settings file (`recorded_shortcuts`) as a layer above `shortcuts.json`, which is never written. The ⋯ button beside the filter copies the path of `shortcuts.json`, copies the recordings as JSON, and resets them all after a confirmation. In Commands, `Ctrl Enter` opens the highlighted command's row with the recorder open. Not checked against a live Rex server, which resolves the layers; the README says what that leaves open.
- **More actions:** Move pane (the focused pane trades places with the one on that side), Resize pane (a border moves 5%), Close other panes… (asks first and outlines the panes it would close), a session by its number in the switcher, whose rows show the keys, and Change shortcuts…. A binding's arguments may carry `when` (`"searching"` on the find actions, `"switching"` on a session's number) so its key is taken only while the find bar or the switcher is open.
- **Theme switcher and library:** Change theme… is a command and an action (`client.theme.choose`); the switcher checks the theme in use, ignores case and accents, takes words in any order and marks what matched. Settings → Themes shows every terminal theme this client can declare as a card in a searchable grid, and switcher rows end in a strip of the theme's colours.
- **Tab appearance:** Settings → Interface → Customize tabs has Tabs fill the toolbar, Icons per tab (0–5), Use colour for icons and Shell icon, over a preview of two sample tabs. The defaults are one icon in the text colour.
- **Terminal settings in sections with previews:** Typography, Colours, Cursor, Keyboard, Selection, Titles and Default shell. New settings: **Cursor style** (Block, Bar, Underline) and **Force style**; **Copy on selection** and **Primary selection** with middle-click paste (both off by default); the selection's foreground and background (Theme, Cell foreground, Cell background); and **Show key sequence hints**. The cursor never blinks.
- **Font picker and typography:** the terminal font is picked from the installed families (Monospaced or All fonts, searched as you type) and shown in its own face. Font style, and on the Advanced font settings page Line height, Character spacing, Render bold and italic and an ordered Fallback fonts list. Style, line height, spacing and bold/italic apply to open terminals at once.
- **Interface switches:** Toolbar (Always show, On hover, Hidden) with a **Reveal toolbar** command and action (`Ctrl Alt Shift T`), Animation style (Snappy, Natural, Off), Show window on launch, and on Customize panes: Horizontal and Vertical padding, Highlight active pane, fading of pane headers that are inactive or in an inactive window, and Focus follows mouse. Only headers fade; terminal content is never dimmed.
- **Generated titles:** Settings → Terminal → Prefer generated titles (off by default) names a tab or pane that has no name of its own by its foreground program and directory, such as `vim - ~/rex`. A title a program sets for itself and a name you gave still show.

### Changed

- **The plus key is spelled `Plus`** in every shortcut hint (`Ctrl Plus` in Commands, menus, tooltips and Settings), so it no longer reads as an unfinished chord.
- **Rune bumped to `d70929a`** (anomalyco/rune `dev`, 920 commits after `100b7d9`), with the vendored window-chrome patches rebased onto it. Two patches are dropped because Rune now provides them: `Tx::toggle_maximize` (now `Tx::toggle_maximized`) and the `fc-list` system-font discovery. The Linux window icon moved into Rune's `rune::set_app_icon`, whose Linux support is still a Rex patch. Scrolling and redraw cost far less: on the acceptance machine, p95 frame CPU while scrolling btop fell from about 35 ms to about 8 ms.
- **Rex now takes Rune's rendering as it is.** Translucent 1 pt rims on chips, popovers, pills and cards are slightly brighter, because borders draw over the fill; at 1.25× and 1.5× they are exactly one device pixel wide. Text line boxes are no longer rounded up to device pixels, so Settings rows are 1 pt tighter. Text uses Rune's new default rasteriser, which is heavier at 1× and unchanged at 2×. Terminal cell size and column positions are unchanged.
- **Accessibility costs a little while the bus is enabled.** The release binary is about 13 MB larger after the bump, about 5 MB of it the accessibility feature. The tree is built on every redraw whenever `org.a11y.Status IsEnabled` is set, even with no screen reader attached: during a 20 Hz full-screen redraw the app used about 0.71 CPU cores with it enabled and 0.59 with it disabled (three rounds on a busy machine; the pre-bump build used 0.66).
- **About page:** a centred header with the app icon, version, install channel and the active server's version replaces the version rows; commit and build date share one row. Versions are printed one way everywhere (`0.6.0`, no `v` on Settings → Updates).
- **Settings layout:** Settings is a wider dialog (816×680, clamped to the window and kept under the toolbar) whose pages are grouped into headed cards with a divider between every row, one-sentence helpers and controls aligned to one edge. The window palette, terminal theme and notice position are popup buttons whose lists open over Settings beside the control instead of replacing it; client label and each host's default shell are rows that open their form (a host's shell form opens under its row, over Settings); pane density and tab position are segmented controls with glyphs. Long pages fade at the scrolled edge and show a scroll thumb. Settings and saved preferences are unchanged. Settings → Shortcuts lists each binding by the name Commands uses, with its keys on the right as the same keycaps menus show.
- **Add host list:** a machine's name stays whole and what the check found is cut with an ellipsis instead (its tooltip has the rest), so a long name no longer collapses to `…` or pushes text past the list. Rows line up in columns (status, system, chevron); **Rex check failed** and a refused hello are in the warning colour and come first; a machine that is already added has an **Added** chip in place of the check mark before its name; and every group (Rex servers, Tailnet, Offline) has an icon. The list is 520 pt wide.
- **Integrations page:** each agent is one row with its mark, a state chip (Installed, Update available, Not installed, Not found, Conflict, Unreadable) and the actions that state allows. The skill several agents share is explained once under the list instead of on every row, **Check again** and **Set up all detected…** are right-aligned with the primary last, and the footnotes are shorter. Previews, per-agent actions and the session-naming default (off) are unchanged.
- **Settings sidebar:** sections have icons and are grouped in a new order: Interface and Themes; Terminal, Shortcuts, Integrations, Notifications and Remote Hosts; Updates and About.
- **Settings rows that moved:** the chrome palette (now **Window colours**) and the **Terminal theme** are together on a new **Themes** section instead of Interface and Terminal; **Pane padding** is on Interface → Customize panes instead of Terminal, as Horizontal padding and Vertical padding (`pane_padding` still sets both until the vertical one is changed); the four notification switches are on their state's page, and the state's row on Notifications says where it shows (`Tabs, Notification`). No saved setting changed.
- **Settings button:** the toolbar's Settings glyph is a gear instead of two sliders.
- **Menus are grouped.** Pane, tab, session and host menus separate their groups with hairlines and end with the rows that close or remove something, in red. The keyboard-selected row is a tinted fill with an outline. Context menus are 280 pt wide.
- **New default bindings take keys from terminal programs:** `Ctrl Shift PageUp` / `PageDown` (move tab), `Ctrl Alt 1`–`8` and `9` (go to a tab, `9` the last), `Ctrl Alt [` and `]` (previous and next pane), `Ctrl Alt Shift` with an arrow (move pane) and `Ctrl Alt Shift T` (Reveal toolbar) no longer reach the focused pane. `F3` / `Shift F3` are taken only while the find bar is open, and `Ctrl 1`–`9` only in the session switcher. Each can be removed or rebound in Settings → Shortcuts or `shortcuts.json`.
- **A selection's outer corners are rounded** by default; Settings → Terminal → Selection → Rounded corners turns that off.
- **Toolbar tabs are capsules**, with the first program icon on a badge and a × on the tab on screen and on a tab under the pointer; closing from it asks first, as the menu does.
- **Terminal fonts are chosen from a list**, not typed: the two-field font form is gone. `--font` and `--font-fallback` still override the saved choices.
- **Window title** is `<tab> - <session> · <host>` (`Rex · <host>` before a session is chosen). A sidebar session row counts its tabs only above one, and the toolbar's identity chip is sized to its words, with the host line only while a second host is connected or the host is reconnecting.
- **Close confirmations name the tab** (`Close <tab>?`) and its host. The pane menu opens on its first row that can run, so `Ctrl Shift Space` then `Enter` pastes (or copies, with a selection) instead of splitting right.
- **Interface zoom actions are named** Increase, Decrease and Reset interface zoom, and their hint is `Ctrl +` rather than the numpad key.

### Fixed

- **An unfocused Rex window no longer overwrites the system clipboard, and its cursor is hollow.** Rune delivers native window focus to the view's first element, but Rex registered its handler on a child of it, so the app never learned that its window lost focus: terminal OSC 52 copies were still applied (the window-focus gate for them never closed) and the focused pane kept a solid block cursor. Window focus now also drives other behavior that was dead before: a bell, Done or notification in the visible tab while the window is unfocused shows the tab's word and can fire a desktop notification, a drag selection ends, the key-sequence state resets and the input method is turned off on blur, and on refocus shortcut override files are reloaded (as the README has long said) and the window re-claims size ownership (with two Rex windows of different sizes on one session, the terminal reflows when you switch between them). Checked on X11 and on a private Wayland compositor; the 0.6.0 release behaves the same way, so this is not new in the Rune bump. Found while looking into a report that OSC 52 copy doesn't work in the Codex CLI (reported by akakabuto).
- DESIGN.md described a **Take control** strip for panes another client had sized; the client never had one. It now says what happens: the window claims its panes when it comes forward and typing or pasting claims a pane, with **Retry** on a reconnecting pane.

### Documentation

- **README: Clipboard (OSC 52).** What copies reach the system clipboard and when, that reads are never answered and large payloads are dropped, and what to do for programs that only send OSC 52 when an `SSH_*` variable is set (the Codex CLI, Neovim 0.10.x, LazyVim) or prefer the server's own clipboard. Rex Linux cannot set environment variables in a remote terminal; the page gives the server-side workarounds that were checked. Reported by akakabuto. This does not change how Codex decides where to copy.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-11-10

### Added

- **In-app update notice and Settings → Updates:** on startup (after 30 seconds) and at most once every 24 hours while running, checks the signed GitHub release manifest (`latest.json` and `latest.json.minisig`) against the embedded CI and backup Minisign public keys (`packaging/keys/release.pub` and `packaging/keys/release-backup.pub`). When a newer stable release is verified, shows a non-blocking update toast with **What's new** (opens the release page in your browser without rendering remote HTML or markdown), **Updates…** and **Dismiss for this version**. Guidance matches the detected install channel (`REX_LINUX_CHANNEL`, `/usr/share/rex-linux/channel` and `~/.local/share/rex-linux/install.json`): `sudo pacman -Syu rex-linux-bin` on Arch (`omarchy update` on Omarchy), the verified `install.sh` one-command upgrade for tarball/script installs, `.deb` upgrade instructions for Debian/Ubuntu, and `nix flake update rex-rune` / `nix profile upgrade rex-linux` for Nix. Includes `rex-linux --check-update`, a **Check now** action, and opt-out via Settings → Updates (`updates.check` in `workspace.json`) or `REX_LINUX_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`; source builds never check automatically, background check failures back off for 24 hours silently, and the client never self-updates or downloads binaries.
- **Pane density and padding:** Settings → Interface → **Pane density** adds a **Compact** mode alongside **Comfortable** (default), removing split pane headers, rounded card borders, shadows, gaps and outer margins in favour of 1 pt split separators while keeping split geometry, divider dragging and floating reconnect controls. Settings → Terminal → **Pane padding** adjusts uniform terminal content padding from 0 to 32 pt (default 8 pt) live without restarting. Adapted from [Loric ANDRE (@LoricAndre)](https://github.com/LoricAndre) ([LoricAndre/rex-rune](https://github.com/LoricAndre/rex-rune), `fd4e753`, `e0be986`, `d3a9cbe`).

### Changed

- **Uniform default pane padding:** terminal content now uses uniform 8 pt padding on all four sides in every pane by default (replacing the previous 12 pt horizontal, 8 pt bottom, and 0 pt split-card top padding), so single panes and split cards share identical inset geometry at a given **Pane padding** setting.

## 0.5.3 - 2026-11-10

### Added

- Signed Arch pacman repository at `https://pkg.shuv.dev/arch/$arch`, with x86_64 and aarch64 packages, signed repository databases and package signatures. See the [setup and migration instructions](docs/auto-update-operator-walkthrough.md#5-the-arch-repository-u2).
- Install channel markers and installer receipts; About identifies the installation channel. Nix installation guidance is available in `docs/nix.md`.

## 0.5.2 - 2026-11-10

### Added

- Signed one-command user installer, published as immutable `install.sh` and `install.sh.minisig` release assets. Embedded CI and backup keys verify release checksums with minisign or OpenSSL 3+ before any downloaded code runs. Supports upgrades, checks, explicit version pins and uninstall; refuses automatic downgrades. Repository-key fallback is opt-in only (`--trust-repo-keys`).

### Changed

- Support Rex API revisions **10–13**, including the official Arch snapshot `0.0.1794323808-g757adf`. Refresh the vendored SDK for the additive `terminal.download_begin` method; existing attachment, upload gating and per-host remote-control consent remain unchanged. File-download UI is not enabled. See [API-13 compatibility notes](docs/server-api13.md).

## 0.5.1 - 2026-11-10

### Added

- Settings → About with app version, build commit/date, connected server API revision, repository/release/license links and Copy version info for bug reports.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-11-10

### Added

- Opt-in Remote control per saved host (off even locally), eight view-only client actions, explicit refusals with server-command alternatives, host/target/panel/typing guards, five-second stale-request limits and reconnect-scoped replies. Every performed request names its host and requester in a six-second in-app notice.
- `session.select session_id=… [window_id=…]` shows a session on the requesting host, with acknowledgement, a five-second deadline and history integration. `client.tab.goto index=-1` selects the last tab. Checked live against private preview.14 servers, including a real SSH host.
- A client label in Settings → Remote Hosts, defaulting to the hostname and sent in HELLO; edits apply after reopening.

- Signed releases with minisign signatures for `SHA256SUMS` and `latest.json`, protected release approval, package provenance attestations, and committed CI and offline recovery public keys (#21, #28). No client auto-update is included.

### Changed

- Update GitHub Actions checkout to 7.0.1, upload-artifact to 7.0.2, and mise-action to 5.2.7 (Dependabot #22–#24).

### Verifying downloads

Verify the metadata signatures before checking package hashes. See the [README's minisign public keys and verification instructions](https://github.com/shuv1337/rex-rune/blob/v0.5.0/README.md#verify-a-download). Releases through 0.4.2 remain unsigned.

## 0.4.2 - 2026-11-09

### Added

- Offer a separately confirmed, one-time personal-server start when SSH finds no default Rex server. Preview the target and command, default to Not now, check local/remote API-12 support, report failures without retrying, and reconnect through the unchanged `ssh -L` transport. Ordinary attachment never starts servers; installation remains manual.
- Add host reads API-12 `server.status` listeners, showing the verified endpoint and a review of bound addresses and admission rules. Older servers and unavailable metadata retain attachment without guessed access rules.
- New tabs and splits start in the source pane's shell directory on its server, including shells that do not report OSC 7; a pane-menu split inherits from the pane the menu names. Missing or slow directory reads fall back to the server's default; new sessions are unchanged. (@kitten-lily)

### Fixed

- Clicking a disabled control, divider or padding inside a dialog no longer dismisses it. Empty space preserves field focus; clicking outside still closes the dialog. (@kitten-lily)

## 0.4.1 - 2026-11-09

### Changed

- Support Rex server 0.1.0-preview.14 (Linux build `7e460d0`), negotiating API revisions **10–12**. Refresh the vendored SDK capture and generated types for optional listener metadata in `server.status` and `session.bootstrap`; uploads still require revision 11.
- When SSH finds no Rex socket, explain attachment-only behavior and suggest the manual `rex server install ssh://host` setup. Socket lookup explicitly disables autostart; existing OpenSSH forwarding, aliases and custom sockets remain supported.

### Fixed

- Answer remote `client_perform_requested` actions with `not_supported` and an explanation instead of leaving agents waiting for a timeout. Remote interface control remains unimplemented; local shortcuts and their queued actions are unchanged.

See [preview.14 compatibility notes](docs/server-preview14.md) for the exact protocol diff, test results and deferred features.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-11-09

Changes since 0.3.2, including work adapted from [Joe Goldin](https://github.com/joegoldin) ([joegoldin/rex-rune](https://github.com/joegoldin/rex-rune)), [Lily](https://github.com/kitten-lily) ([kitten-lily/rex-rune](https://github.com/kitten-lily/rex-rune)) and [Andrea Zito (nivox)](https://github.com/nivox). Thank you; their contributions are credited below and in the commits.

### Added

- **Tailnet host discovery:** Add host lists and searches your Tailscale machines, using Tailscale IPs when MagicDNS is unavailable. Online machines are checked for Rex at the addresses the official clients use; connect to a detected server with one press, or enter an SSH login and optional socket path. Manual endpoints and multiple logins to the same machine remain supported.
- **SSH socket forwarding:** connect with `ssh://[user@]host[:port][/socket]` using an existing SSH login, including Tailscale SSH, without reconfiguring Rex. The client discovers the remote Rex socket when no path is given and forwards it with `ssh -L`. Each client instance keeps its own forwards; disconnects show SSH's reason next to Retry.
- **Global navigation and visit history:** Ctrl Tab and Ctrl Shift Tab cycle through tabs across connected hosts and sessions in sidebar order. Mouse Back/Forward and Commands revisit this window's history, including across reconnects, skipping unavailable targets. Rapid cross-session cycling briefly settles before attachment without enabling extra prefetch; Ctrl PageUp/PageDown still use the server's current-session navigation. (@joegoldin)
- **Configurable shortcuts through Rex's `client.keymap`:** bindings in a host's Rex config now apply, layered with Linux defaults and user overrides in `~/.config/rex-linux/shortcuts.json`. Rebind or remove any workspace shortcut, including Ctrl Tab, to let it reach terminal programs. Supports multi-key sequences, layout-aware logical and physical keys, Lua forwarding and server actions, plus explicit `pane.send_key`, tab selection and pane resizing. (@nivox)
- Settings → Shortcuts shows effective bindings, their sources, file paths and Problems; Commands follows rebinding and a toolbar chip shows pending sequences. Override files reload on window focus or opening Settings and are not rewritten by workspace saves. Invalid files leave defaults working, and unavailable server keymaps use local defaults plus overrides. Custom bindings from nivox's format import once without copying defaults or replacing an existing override file. (@nivox)
- **Terminal search:** Ctrl Shift F searches the focused pane's screen and scrollback with Ghostty's search. Matches are highlighted; Enter and Shift Enter step through them, and Escape returns the keyboard to the terminal. Search-field typing and clicks stay out of the running program. (@kitten-lily)
- **Activity, progress and bells:** OSC 9;4 progress appears beneath tab labels and split-pane names, with OSC 7501 percentages as a fallback and words for Paused or Error. Each split pane shows its own activity and, unless renamed, its program's terminal title. An unseen terminal bell marks its tab Bell until viewed. Progress clears with its reporting program but survives while a child holds the foreground. (@kitten-lily)

### Changed

- **Terminal fidelity:** programs can select block, bar or underline cursors; curly, dotted, dashed and double underlines use their requested colours, and overlines are supported. Box-drawing and block characters meet on whole device pixels without seams, and decoration thickness respects fractional display scaling. (@kitten-lily)
- A pane owned by this client waits up to half a second for a frame at its own size before drawing, avoiding a flash of the previous client's dimensions without waiting indefinitely. (@kitten-lily)
- Settings → Terminal identifies saved font changes that need a client restart and font families that are not installed; saving a family change also shows a restart notice.

### Fixed

- SSH connections no longer get stuck reconnecting when SSH config enables `ControlMaster auto`. Forwards stay off shared control masters and keep their login open for the connection's lifetime.
- Silently dropped server connections, such as after laptop sleep, are detected within about 30 seconds using TCP keepalives so hosts and terminals can reconnect. (@kitten-lily)
- Shift Space, Shift Tab and Shift Enter reach Kitty-keyboard programs such as Claude Code as distinct keys. Shift is retained unless the keyboard layout used it to produce the character. Held within-session navigation works again, stale consumed-key state no longer swallows fresh presses, and forwarded terminal input releases focus from UI controls. (@kitten-lily for modified-key handling)
- Search highlights and selected matches stay correctly positioned in clipped or scrolled panes. Closing search during a host reconnect clears its highlights, and a failed search reports a notice instead of dropping the terminal stream. (@kitten-lily)
- Back/Forward retains the right history position after failed or superseded navigation; expired queued visits no longer attach later, and selecting a reconnecting host's session no longer bounces back. (@joegoldin for the navigation foundation)
- Terminal sizes, themes and activity are restored before refreshing shortcuts after reconnect. Local action-request errors no longer disconnect the host, returned actions can finish after pane-focus updates, and changed overrides also reach hosts that were offline.
- The X11 smoke test now holds modifiers through key releases and checks pointer selection at the correct cell boundary. It requires an explicit disposable server and stubs tailnet discovery rather than contacting real tailnet machines.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-11-06

- First prebuilt Linux releases for x86-64 and ARM64: user-installable tarballs and Debian/Ubuntu packages, with SHA-256 checksums.
- Automated native builds and tests on Ubuntu 24.04. No application behavior changes since 0.3.1.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-11-06

- Only Rex API revisions 10 and 11 are supported; servers older than revision 10 are refused with a message to update Rex. The revision-7 and revision-8 compatibility paths and `scripts/revision8-check.py` are gone.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-11-06

Changes since the 0.2.0 public release on 2026-11-01. Many of them come from two forks; thank you to [Joe Goldin](https://github.com/joegoldin) ([joegoldin/rex-rune](https://github.com/joegoldin/rex-rune)) and [Lily](https://github.com/kitten-lily) ([kitten-lily/rex-rune](https://github.com/kitten-lily/rex-rune)), credited on each item below and as authors or co-authors of the commits.

### Terminal

- Drop files on a pane, or paste copied files or a screenshot with Ctrl+Shift+V, and Rex uploads them to the machine that terminal runs on and types their paths, local or remote, with no SSH setup. Needs a Rex server with API revision 11; older servers say so. ([#2](https://github.com/shuv1337/rex-rune/issues/2), requested by @joegoldin)
- The client speaks Rex API revisions 7 to 11, and doesn't draw floating layers another client minimized.
- Inline images with the Kitty graphics protocol, restored when you reattach. Adds a patched copy of `ghostty-vt` under `vendor/`. (@joegoldin)
- Copies made by terminal programs (OSC 52) reach your clipboard, accepted only from the focused pane while the window is focused. Remote programs still can't read your clipboard. (@joegoldin)
- Double-click selects a word or shell path and triple-click a line; a selection stays attached to its text while output scrolls, and dragging past the edge autoscrolls. (@joegoldin)
- Ctrl+click opens web and mail links, including OSC 8 hyperlinks; the tooltip shows the real target. `file://` links are never opened. (@kitten-lily)
- Full-screen programs no longer flicker while they redraw (synchronized output). (@kitten-lily)
- Tabs with a server-generated name show their program's title, as tabs called "Shell" already did. (@joegoldin)
- Terminal themes: Settings → Terminal → Theme sends a theme to the server with Rex's `set_theme`, so programs that ask for colours get the ones on screen. Other clients viewing a terminal see the theme while this client owns it, as they see its size. Choose Rex's default colours, Midnight, any Ghostty theme you have installed, or follow the chrome palette. The default, Follow server, changes nothing. (@kitten-lily)
- The terminal font family and fallback families are saved in Settings → Terminal; only the families you name are loaded. (@joegoldin, @kitten-lily)

### Keyboard

- Dead-key accents are typed into the terminal, including an accent followed by Space. (@kitten-lily)
- Programs can tell Shift+Enter, Shift+Tab and Shift+Backspace from the unshifted keys. (@kitten-lily)
- Key releases are sent correctly when nothing in the window has focus. (@kitten-lily, @joegoldin)
- Alt+arrows reach terminal programs (word movement in shells and editors); switching panes moved to Ctrl+Alt+arrows. (@joegoldin)
- Ctrl+Shift+V pastes only into the pane that asked, even if focus moves before the clipboard read returns.

### Window and navigation

- Chrome palettes, switchable live in Settings → Interface → Theme: Midnight (the default, unchanged), Rosé Pine, Rosé Pine Moon and Gruvbox Dark. (@joegoldin, @kitten-lily)
- Program activity on tabs (OSC 7501: "Needs approval", "Error", "Done" and so on), program icons, and desktop notifications for tabs you aren't looking at.
- Settings in sections (Interface, Terminal, Notifications, Integrations, Remote Hosts, Shortcuts), including adding, editing and removing hosts.
- A single pane draws edge to edge; tabs and toolbar restyled.
- Tabs in the sidebar: Settings → Interface → Tab position → Sidebar lists each session's tabs under it while the sidebar is open. (@joegoldin)
- The sidebar opens at launch as you left it. (@kitten-lily)
- A Settings button in the toolbar; the toolbar's buttons share one plain hover style, and the minimize and maximize buttons are gone.
- Edit a host (name, endpoint, default shell) from its sidebar menu, from Commands or from an offline session's menu.
- Rename and close sessions in place in the switcher and from the session chip.
- The pane menu opens on right-click even over programs that track the mouse.

### Integrations and packaging

- Settings → Integrations installs, updates or removes Rex's skill and session hooks for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode and Pi with the local `rex skill`, always previewed first.
- OMP (oh-my-pi) in Settings → Integrations. It shares Pi's skill directory, so it uses Rex's Pi setup until Rex knows OMP. (@kitten-lily)
- `rex` is also found in `~/.local/bin` (or `$XDG_BIN_HOME`), not only on `PATH`. (@kitten-lily)
- A Nix flake with pinned packages and desktop integration; see [docs/nix.md](docs/nix.md). (@joegoldin)
- Optional mise tasks, and `scripts/install-desktop.sh --copy` / `--uninstall`. (@kitten-lily)
