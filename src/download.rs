//! Files downloaded from a terminal's machine through Rex (`download_begin`, API revision 13).
//!
//! This module is the library side: file names, the destination folder, the partial file, the
//! limits, the transfer state machine and the stream that fills the file. The connection layer
//! (`connection::HostCommand::Download`) drives it; nothing here has a UI or opens or runs a
//! downloaded file.
//!
//! The wire contract is in `docs/server-api13.md` ("Download contract (D0)"): the ticket's data
//! stream carries the file as binary messages of at most 32 KiB, then one empty message, then a
//! normal close (1000). Anything else is a failure, and a failed or cancelled transfer deletes
//! its partial file. Nothing is ever retried.
